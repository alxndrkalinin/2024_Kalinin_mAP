# A versatile information retrieval framework for evaluating profile strength and similarity

This repository contains the source code to reproduce the results in the
paper: "[A versatile information retrieval framework for evaluating profile strength and similarity](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.01.587631)".

## Getting started

### System requirements
This repository supports Python 3.9+ and should work with all modern operating systems (tested with MacOS 13.5, Ubuntu 18.04).

### Dependencies
This code depends on widely used Python packages:
* numpy
* scipy
* pandas
* jupyter
* seaborn
* networkx
* umap-learn
* scikit-learn

It also uses [pycytominer](https://github.com/alxndrkalinin/pycytominer/tree/fix-ops-custom-features) for profiling data preprocessing and [copairs](https://github.com/cytomining/copairs/tree/v0.4.3) for profile grouping and mAP calculations.


### Installation

We suggest using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/) for
environment management. The following commands create the environment from
scratch and install the required packages.

```bash
conda create -n map_eval "python>=3.9"
conda activate map_eval
pip install .
```

#### R installation
Preprocessing of [Perturb-seq data](./experiments/6_perturbseq/) requires creating a separate R environment:

```bash
conda env create -f perturbseq_processing_environment.yml
```

## Contents

Results are organized per dataset in the [experiments](./experiments/) subdirectory.

Each experiment directory  includes brief description of the dataset and scripts and/or Jupyter notebooks to download and preprocess data, calculate metrics, and generate figures for the paper.

### Experiments

1. [Simulations](./experiments/1_simulations/) (Figures 2, S2-5)
2. [CellHealth data](./experiments/2_cellhealth/) (Figures 3, S6)
3. [cpg0004 data](./experiments/3_cpg0004/) (Figures S7A, S7C)
4. [cpg0016orf data](./experiments/4_cpg0016orf/) (Figures S7B, S7D)
5. [nELISA data](./experiments/5_nelisa/) (Figures 4A-B)
6. [Perturb-seq data](./experiments/6_perturbseq/) (Figures 4C-D, S5A-B, S8)
7. [Mitocheck data](./experiments/7_mitocheck/) (Figure 5C-D, S9-10)
